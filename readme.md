

## Basic info
This work is based on: https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/commits/master
Currently based on commit 5c8d9b.
(This work is not based on FiraCode. 
 I personally don't like font ligatures.)

It changes 2 chars in Fira Mono, `&` and `@` (both comes from other open source font), 
![Image Fira Mono Mz](./FiraMonoMz.PNG)
![Image Fira Mono](./FiraMono.PNG)

The `.ttf` files are fonts for download.
Just like Fira Mono, this work is also free and open-source.


## Project Intro for font hackers
We have 3 font-forge prject files:
+ `FiraMonoMz-Bold.sfdir\`: font-forge project file for font `FiraMonoMz-Bold`.
+ `FiraMonoMz-Medium.sfdir\`: font-forge project file for font `FiraMonoMz-Medium`.
+ `FiraMonoMz-Regular.sfdir\`: font-forge project file for font `FiraMonoMz-Regular`.

For other files, see next section.


## Need post-processing to make font be reconized as "Monospaced font"
```sh
python fixmono.py FiraMonoMz-Regular.ttf
python fixmono.py FiraMonoMz-Medium.ttf
python fixmono.py FiraMonoMz-Bold.ttf
```
What is done: the script set the `isFixedPitch` of each font to `1`.

See: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/bin/scripts/fpfix.py

### why need post-preocessing
See file `0 width glyph.log` (which is the output of 
`grep "^Width:" *.glyph > "../0 width glyph.log"`) for detail:
search for keyword 'Width: 0', you can see 27 chars have 0 width.

As a result, the font generated by font-forge will not set the `isFixedPitch` to 1, 
which makes some software couldn't recognize the font as Monospaced font.

See more about why font-forge do not automatically set `isFixedPitch`: http://fontforge.10959.n7.nabble.com/Regenerated-font-does-not-recognize-as-a-Monospace-in-Windows-td11291.html
